# Lung-Cancer-Analysis-Project
Lung Cancer Analysis (Minor Project)

Project Overview:
This project involves the analysis of a dataset related to lung cancer patients. The goal is to explore the data, identify significant patterns, and understand the distribution of lung cancer cases based on various patient attributes.

Dataset:
The dataset contains various attributes of patients that may contribute to the risk of lung cancer. Key attributes include:

Patient ID: Unique identifier for each patient

Age: Age of the patient

Gender: Gender of the patient

Air Pollution: Level of exposure to air pollution

Alcohol Use: Level of alcohol consumption

Dust Allergy: Severity of dust allergy

Occupational Hazards: Exposure to occupational hazards

Genetic Risk: Genetic predisposition to lung cancer

Chronic Lung Disease: Presence of chronic lung diseases

Level: Categorization of lung cancer severity (Low, Medium, High)
... and several other factors including symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath, etc.

Project Structure

Loading Necessary Libraries:
The project utilizes libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Data Import:
The dataset is imported, and the first few rows are displayed to understand the structure and the types of data present.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Any steps taken to clean or preprocess the data before analysis should be described here.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Detailed exploration of the data to identify patterns, correlations, and distributions.

Results:
This project focuses on the analysis portion to understand the dataset, rather than developing predictive models. The results include a bar plot showing the distribution of lung cancer cases among male and female patients.

How to Run the Project

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible IDE

Installation:
Install necessary Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn

Running the Analysis:
Open the notebook and run the cells in order.

Conclusion
Since this is a minor project, no predictive models have been applied to the dataset. The primary focus is on understanding the data and drawing conclusions about the prevalence of lung cancer within the dataset. The analysis reveals the number of patients who have lung cancer and those who do not, with the results visually represented through a bar plot. Additionally, the distribution between male and female patients is highlighted.
